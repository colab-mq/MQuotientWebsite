Automating VAT Invoice Requests: Boosting Efficiency and Accuracy with Power Automate
The Challenge
A multinational retail chain faced a recurring operational burden in handling VAT invoice requests from corporate customers. The manual process involved receiving invoice requests via email, validating order and payment details, and manually generating compliant VAT invoices. This led to delays, inconsistencies, and a growing backlog, especially during peak retail periods, impacting customer satisfaction and compliance standards.

Our Solution
We developed and deployed a low-code automation solution using Microsoft Power Automate to streamline and fully automate the VAT invoice request workflow. The system integrated with the client’s email, ERP, and invoicing platforms to auto-capture requests, validate inputs, generate invoices, and send them back to requestors—without human intervention.
