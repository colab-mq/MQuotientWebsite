Case Study 2: Enhancing the OPEX Tool with Power Platform
The Challenge
The organization’s OPEX tool was cumbersome and outdated, requiring multiple disconnected projects for managing financial inputs. Manual data entry, lack of a mass upload function, and a clunky interface slowed down operations. Teams struggled to maintain accurate financial oversight and spent unnecessary hours performing basic tasks.
