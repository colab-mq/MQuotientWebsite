Optimizing Process: RPA in Purchase Order ETA Management
The Challenge
A global supply chain team in a leading consumer goods company struggled with managing Purchase Order ETA confirmations. The existing manual process required employees to log into multiple supplier portals, download shipment updates, reconcile expected delivery dates, and update internal systems. This caused delays, errors, and inefficiencies, particularly when handling thousands of POs each month.

Our Solution
We implemented a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solution using UiPath to automate the end-to-end PO ETA tracking and update process. The bot was designed to log in to various supplier portals, extract shipment and ETA information, compare it with expected delivery data, and update the enterprise system of record automatically.

Implementation Highlights
Created a bot to mimic user actions across diverse supplier platforms

Integrated structured data extraction with logic for ETA comparison

Automated updates into the internal PO management system

Scheduled bot runs to ensure real-time updates throughout the day

Included alerts for exception handling and discrepancies requiring human review
